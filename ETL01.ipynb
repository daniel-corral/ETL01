JSON puede representar cuatro tipos primitivos(cadenas, números, booleanos, valores nulos) y dos tipos estructurados(objetos y arreglos). JSON puede ser leído por cualquier lenguaje de programación.

    "Spark SQL puede inferir automáticamente el esquema de un conjunto de datos JSON y cargarlo como un Dataset[Fila]. Esta conversión puede hacerse usando SparkSession.read.json() ya sea en un Dataset[String], o en un archivo JSON. Tenga en cuenta que el archivo que se ofrece como un archivo json no es un archivo JSON típico. Cada línea debe contener un objeto JSON válido independiente y autónomo. Para más información, por favor vea el formato de texto de las líneas JSON, también llamado JSON delimitado por nuevas líneas.\n",
